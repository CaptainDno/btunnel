This package provides a way to make tcp traffic look similar to Bittorrent connection.

Additional description and documentation will be added after active development finishes.

Considerations:
* This is experimental package, mainly intended for use in my other projects.
* Mimicking is done on best effort basis. This means, that Bittorrent protocol may be violated to some extent if it is needed to maintain acceptable connection speed.
